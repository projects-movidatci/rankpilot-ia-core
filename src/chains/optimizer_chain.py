       - The Commercial/Legal Challenge.
       - The Firm's Strategic Role/Maneuver (Explicitly highlighting the 'firm_role_taxonomy' and 'complexity_indicators' found in the JSON).
       - The Market Impact/Value.
    4. TONE: Use active, powerful verbs (e.g., 'Spearheaded', 'Engineered', 'Architected'). Eliminate passive voice completely.
    5. FACTS: Retain all specific monetary values, jurisdictions, and dates. Do NOT invent data.
